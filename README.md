# Music_Player

TO RUN

Make sure you have an emulator selected, in my example I used Nexus 5 API 26. Once gradle has finished updating and everything is indexed app should properly run if you have emulator setup. 

TO TEST FUNCTIONALITY

Open application, select song and press play. 
Test stop button
Select new song to play and exit out of app to use other apps
Music should continue playing
Stop inside app to stop music
